Hey, this is **Anand**, the owner of this blog. I am a CS undergrad and I love to learn. This is just a pastime project for me. I have always loved to share my experiences but didn't want to be left on seen. So I decided to create a blog. And this is that blog.

Incase you are wondering, the name of the blog references Jolly Roger. The blog will mostly contain my thoughts on tech related topics and will also occassionally contain my personal experiences. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.

Contact me if you want to talk about anything. I am always up for a chat. If you can find me, that is.

Also, if you need setting up your own blog, I have written a [guide](/blog/2021/01/setting-up-a-blog/) for that. Check it out.
